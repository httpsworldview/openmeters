# Iced pane_grid licensing

The files under `src/ui/pane_grid/` are adapted from the `pane_grid` widget in [`iced_widget` v0.13.4](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced).

The live code is a lightweight adaptation that only supports horizontal ordering and simple pane swapping.

The original source is licensed under the MIT License. In accordance with that license:

- These files retain the original copyright header, with an added note indicating they are adapted from `iced_widget`.
- The `iced_widget` MIT License text is reproduced below for convenience.
